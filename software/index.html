			<h1>Software</h1>
			<p>I develop and maintain the Python/C++ package <a href="https://dynamic-fba.readthedocs.io">dfba</a> for dynamic flux-balance analysis (DFBA) simulations. This is joint work with <a href="https://twitter.com/me_beber?lang=en">Moritz E. Beber</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jorge_Carrasco_Muriel2">Jorge Carrasco Muriel</a> that forms part of the <a href="https://opencobra.github.io/">openCOBRA</a> code base for constraint-based reconstruction and analysis of metabolic models. </p>
            
            <p> Other software and scripts for data processing can be accessed via <a href="https://gitlab.com/davidtourigny">GitLab</a> </p>
            
            <p> During my PhD I worked on a maximum likelihood-based algorithm for clustering and inferring diffraction data from macromolecular crystals (today, this would probably be called machine learning). Details can be found in the second section of my <a href="./PhD_Tourigny2014.pdf" class="download" title="thesis">thesis</a> </p>
