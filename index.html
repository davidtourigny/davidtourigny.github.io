			<h1>David S. Tourigny</h1>
			<p> I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow of the <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/">Simons Foundation</a> and <a href="http://www.lsrf.org/">LRSF</a> hosted by Columbia University Medical Center, New York. Previously, I was a Research Fellow in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (<a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/">DAMTP</a>) at the University of Cambridge, where I also completed my PhD under the supervision of <a href="https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/group-leaders/n-to-s/venki-ramakrishnan/">Venki Ramakrishnan</a> and <a href="https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/group-leaders/h-to-m/garib-murshudov/">Garib Murshudov</a> at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology as a member of Trinity College. </p>
            
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <h3>Spatiotemporal regulation of metabolism and protein synthesis</h3>
            <p> My current research focus is on understanding the dynamic regulation of metabolism in space and time. I have used both experimental and theoretical approaches to study metabolism in a variety of contexts, ranging from microbial systems to neuronal networks. Recently, I have become interested in the way that individual organisms and populations employ 'bet-hedging' strategies for optimal allocation of limited metabolic resources in the face of uncertainty (see <a href="/publications">Publications</a> for more details). Having previously worked on the ribosome during my PhD, I have a longer-term ambition to study the integration of metabolism with protein synthesis as one of the most energy-demanding processes inside the cell. </p>
            
            <h3>Dynamical systems and control theory</h3>
            <p> Most of my work involves mathematical modelling based on Applied Dynamical Systems Theory and Optimal Control Theory. In the past, I also have worked on these topics in their own right with relatively less application. Specifically, this involved some geometric properties of certain dynamical systems (see <a href="/publications">Publications</a>). </p>
            
            <h3>Scientific software</h3>
            <p> I am continually developing software tools for my own research purposes as well the larger scientific community. See <a href="/software">Software</a> for more information. </p>
